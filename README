Simple code for parallel execution of enqueued items.

We use a similar version in our business to handle all the queues like SMS, callbacks, CDR and slow sql querys.

The basic method is to call URLs and then the web server process the item.

The early version of this code only process simulated items, in a future i'll implement a URL call, enqueuer and workers.

The reason behind not tu use a traditional AMPQ is that we need total persistence and a fixed throughput.

Im plannig to use a Pub/Sub system with Redis as enqueuer.
